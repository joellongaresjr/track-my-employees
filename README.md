## Learning Points

* This assignment from Berkley's Extension Program provided me with a valuable learning opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of MySQL. It allowed me to practice using SQL language to construct a table based on our query database, enhancing my skills in working with databases and data manipulation.

* Disclaimer: applying new features in the future, I know that I can implement the display better in the CLI and making it more user friendly. I hope that as time goes on, I can use this project as reference to enchance my knowledge in SQL language. I'm especially looking forward to implement more practice of this language to my logisitics business to acquire data more efficiently overall.
